## Interpretation

The funnel shows that the product performs effectively at all stages.  
There is no significant drop‑off - the conversion rates between steps are high.  
The only anomaly is conv1 > 100%, which can be explained by the fact that ‘view’ events are recorded more frequently than ‘visit’ events.
