# SQL_user_events_ecommerce_casual_wear
This dataset contains 320,000+ event-level user interaction records generated from a simulated global digital platform. Each row represents a single user event, capturing how users move through a typical product funnel and how they return over time.  
##The primary goal of this project was to analyze and explore:
1. User funnel analysis (Visit → View → Add to Cart → Checkout → Purchase)
2. Conversion rate and drop-off analysis
3. Retention and cohort analysis (weekly/monthly)
4. New vs returning user behavior
5. Session-based user activity
6. Device-wise and traffic-source-wise performance
7. Product category and pricing insights
